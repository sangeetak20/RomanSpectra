# Overview

This repository is made to guide a user through degrading spectra to Roman Grism resolution and be able to calculate line flux and estimate redshift from the methods used here. 

The notebook `RomanDataChallenge.ipynb` walks the user through these goals and gives them an opportunity to also use spectra that have been degraded to Roman Grism resolution 

The folder `spectra` contains the template spectra used in the notebook as well as galaxy spectra for the user to use in the notebook.
